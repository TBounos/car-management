It has the capability to display all the records, enter new ones, delete, as well as, modify existing ones. Additionally, it has a search function allowing the user to search by number, color, manufacturer, and manufacturing date. For the number and manufacturing date search function you choose between smaller than `<`, equal to `=`, and larger than `>` followed by the number you want; while for the color and manufacturer function you can either type the whole word or just the first few letters(e.g. `n` instead of `Nissan`).
